# Manager

Just a little manager app to help me focus on things like unit testing and VueJS with Inertia. 

Right now I'm starting with a basic task management app, but will build onto this as a
sort of control panel for my life. 

### Tasks

This will be a very simple task manager, which will have the following tables.

**Tasks**

* Category
* Title
* Description
* Duration (Short, Medium Long)
* Date Created

**Task Results**
* Task 
* Date Completed
